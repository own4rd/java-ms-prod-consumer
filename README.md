# User/Email Microservices

This project demonstrates the use of microservices architecture with a **Producer/Consumer** communication pattern. The technologies and components used include:

- **Java 17+**
- **RabbitMQ** (for message queuing, you can find more information here)
- **Hibernate**
- **Postgres**

## Overview

The **Producer/Consumer** pattern is commonly employed in distributed systems to handle asynchronous communication between services. 

- **Producer**:
    - Responsible for generating and sending messages.
    - Produces data or events and places them into a specific queue.

- **Consumer**:
    - Responsible for receiving and processing messages generated by the producer, in this project, the Email Message.
    - Consumes data or events from the queue.
    
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your RabbitMQ instance
3. Configure your Java application to connect to RabbitMQ (Properties examples inside the services/README)
5. Run the microservices and observe the communication flow.
